- Premium, which turns off the constant barrage of annoying ads that play before, after and even during short videos, costs about the same as a Netflix subscription. YouTube Premium represents terrible value. 

- Dislikes hidden. YouTube removed the dislike counter. This has had the effect of only showing positive engagement. For example, if a video tutorial shows dangerous or incorrect information, it might have had 5 likes and 675 dislikes. It would be obvious to anybody this video was of poor quality, contentious, or malicious. Now, all you will see is 5 likes. So misinformation like ¡°drink XYZ  to cure XYZ¡± will now appear as well liked and well received.

every single video on youtube now opens with two or three (mostly unskippable) ads. maybe this wouldnt be so bad if that was all but sadly thats not the case. more often than not theres also another set of two or three ads. i could watch a twenty minute video with three sets of three ads. that is 9 ads all together. youtube is slowly getting greedier and greedier and i hate to watch it happen. 

the odd ad or two before was understandable but its got out of hand. all these ads are ruining youtube for me- the app i used to use the most is now one of my least used simply due to all the ads :/ no longer can i enjoy a markiplier playthrough without being interrupted by some 30 second unskippable foot cream advert followed by another two </3",17.23.6,negative,ad disruption

1,6.17,"YouTube has been my go-to social platform for many years now, however the current state of YouTube is simply appalling, and the team at Google seems to not care about any of it.
Firstly, the spam problem is simply getting out of control. The comments section has been filled with 18+ and crypto bots copying other comments and linking to sketchy websites completely freely, while actually informative comments get striked down immediately. There also seems to be a loophole that allows Shorts creators to upload the exact same video hundreds of times to their channel with the same stupid premise, while completely innocent creators get terminated for absurd reasons, which brings me onto my next point.
The current copyright system on YouTube is completely broken, allowing pretty much anyone to terminate any channel they want to for including content the creator doesn¡¯t even use, or the reporter doesn¡¯t own. This seems to happen on the regular and it¡¯s infuriating how YouTube deals with them.
Finally, YouTube seems determined to kill their own platform by removing every feature that made it great without providing any alternatives. It started with annotations and the video editor, which wasn¡¯t too bad, but then they removed community closed captions, polls in videos, and most importantly, the ability to see dislikes. We have already seen how this feature is wreaking havoc on the platform, with scammers, bots, and generally scummy people gaining more attention than ever before, all in the name of preventing ¡°dislike attacks¡± and ¡°listening to the community¡±, when I have never seen any creator over the age of 8 complaining about dislikes and have never seen any creator PERIOD wishing for them to be removed.",17.23.6,negative,

Today, I mostly use YouTube for the shorts and all together the app is really good, however,  the only reason why I wouldn¡¯t give it a five star is because when it doesn¡¯t let you comment or like a video without using an account kinda annoys me sometimes - although I do understand the reason why YouTube wouldn¡¯t  let you it¡¯s just sometimes annoying ¡­ so basically my review is 5 stars - I literally can¡¯t think of anything negative to say about YouTube, I use it every single day for entertainment ¡­ and I know this is a big thing to say, but if I¡¯m being completely honest I would say that the shorts are better than TikTok. Obviously this is a very big debate and lots of people may disagree¡­ but I have both apps and comparing in my opinion, I would use YouTube shorts over TikTok just because they are basically the same, however I just feel like YouTube shorts is more accessible and I personally find the layout is better and easier to 
a) make your own short and 
b) find shorts as well as watching ordinary YouTube videos. 
I hope this review was helpful to you and I hope your journey with YouTube will be just as good as mine.

1,6.15,"The app functions brilliantly. Haven¡¯t encountered any glitches or bugs recently and have enjoyed using the app. 

However YouTube as a platform seriously needs to step up their game as their PR keeps taking hits left and right all because they keep making decisions that hurt not only themselves but the creators on their platform as well. 

In recent years YouTube has made it more difficult for their content creators to create fun and engaging content. While there are some on YouTube who are still creating good content, there are many more that create terrible content, and I¡¯m not talking about channels that creat low quality content. I¡¯m more so referring to channels that create content that promotes self victimization and the abuse of YouTube¡¯s copyright system.

Take for example Quantum TV, a man who has been ban dodging for the past 4 years now, and has told the player bases of games he doesn¡¯t enjoy (namely Elden Ring) to go kill themselves. People have been giving YouTube more and more proof that this person is going against YouTube¡¯s terms of service agreement and should have his channel taken down.

YouTube has seen the videos providing proof that Quantum TV should be banned, but instead of doing that, YouTube has decided to demonetize the channels that have spoken out about this issue. All so that they don¡¯t have to own up to their mistakes while pandering to an all around terrible person.",17.23.6,negative,

This all seemed to happen after an update a while back. It would be nice if Google could do an update to fix these issues? Unless this is an issue with Apple? However, I had not done any updates from Apple prior to this issue.

1,6.14,"YouTube may seem nice at first, but there have been so many things wrong with it lately. First, there was the deliberately increased amount of unskippable ads which practically commercialize YouTube through both ad revenue and attempting to entice users to buy your ¡°premium¡±. To make matters worse, many of these ads pop up at terrible times on so many videos. Next, YouTube removed dislikes in the name of ¡°Giving Small YouTubers a voice¡± while simultaneously silencing the voices of users and preventing them from calling out bad videos, providing criticism, and even calling out clickbait. This has resulted in an increased amount of clickbait. I should also mention the increased amounts of wrongful copyright strikes I have seen against many YouTubers, especially the meme channels, with many memes being muted because corporations want people to pay for things that they don¡¯t even want to make money off of, which again makes YouTube too commercialized. There are also the fake gameplay ads that are attempts to make themselves look cool that are so pathetic that they are the complete opposite of cool. Seriously, how do they not count as false advertising? Now, YouTube is age restricting videos that don¡¯t even fit the criteria of age restrictions. The current state of YouTube is awful. Now in recent days, I have just noticed that the ads have not only increased in frequency but in length as well. Almost every night I listen to creepypastas while I sleep, but too many ads have caused me to wake up just to skip them. On top of that, the amount of instances where two 15 second unskippable ads pop up in a row have increased and ads that last for minutes with 20 second waits before skipping have began showing up too. I bet YouTube¡¯s campaign of annoying us into buying their Premium was either not effective enough or it was but they simply just want more of that sweet $$$ from annoyed users.

Good ole goog doesn¡¯t just want to keep track of your YouTube history, it was basically everything else you do on your phone as well.  Shouldn¡¯t have to sell your soul just to use an app. Doesn¡¯t really seem like something that would need mentioning but here we are.

Ads, there¡¯s lots of them. A lot. Some of them wildly inappropriate, things I¡¯d be mortified to have coming out of my phone¡¯s speakers in public. But when it comes to creator content, they can censor that all they want. 

Kinda funny when you think about it, they don¡¯t care about the rules they themselves make if they¡¯re making money off it.

The only real thing I¡¯d ask to fix is the app¡¯s behavior when saving videos to playlists. Trying to save accurately to the playlist I want has become a chore. Tapping the save button will automatically save the video to the last playlist saved to. I watch videos across different subjects, so I¡¯d like to be able to choose where to save by default. 

Then, as I try to move my video to the correct playlist, the app will not respect the checks/unchecks I just did. I¡¯ll tap to see that the video is in both intended and unintended playlists. It¡¯s oddly frustrating, because the rest of the app is really pretty great.

Regarding application ¡®YouTube: Watch,Listen,Stream¡¯ inclusion of YouTube Shorts and paid marketing.

Creators are placing marketing sponsors videos at the end and at the beginning of their videos (in the actual video content) and YOU placing marketing before their videos or in their videos is too much marketing . YOU do not control when a creator has the capability of putting a marketing video inside of their content or not .

I say just a week; because I have to limit myself, otherwise I may spend all my time on You Tube.

I have cable tv, Amazon Prime, I subscribe to many podcasts, and national radio shows. Still none of these can fill the gap You Tube fills for me. Sometimes it¡¯s a Movie I can¡¯t find anywhere else. Sometimes it¡¯s a version of a song I love, and I can¡¯t find this one particular version of the song I love so much. Then I find this one version of the song I love so much is in video form, and You Tube¡¯s the only place I can go to hear it. There maybe concerts, and other videos of artists, musical groups I enjoy. I can watch ballets, listen to operas; there maybe truth on different subjects I¡¯m interested in. And You Tube is my source for finding the information I¡¯m looking for. It¡¯s always interesting, always engaging, always mind captivating. I can listen to teachings I hear at my church. Even my place of work posts something on You Tube. I may need instruction from some one who does it for a living. To fix a dryer, range, other appliance. Maybe a car repair; it maybe something at beginner level, or a repair a master mechanic should only attempt. There¡¯s doctors who regularly come on You Tube; who give advice on better diet, even target specific areas in a persons health. I also find You Tube very educational. Whatever it is I¡¯m working on, many times I try bringing it up on You Tube. I¡¯ve even seen musicians give lessons on how to play songs on different instruments. And everything's geared to help the individual. No ones out to make any money or profit; it¡¯s The You Tube community sharing they¡¯re knowledge. If your new to You Tube, please let me welcome you.

I mean, really!!??)and the insincere pausing of videos to ¡°ask if I¡¯m still watching¡± as a ruse to annoy further, will not work for me. I don¡¯t respond well to sticks, especially when the carrot isn¡¯t particularly good, and shouldn¡¯t be necessary in the first place. All it provides is, ¡°We¡¯ll stop being incredibly annoying if you give me money¡±, I mean don¡¯t they see how low that is?
I¡¯m only waiting until someone with more sense starts a similar platform and I will drop youtube like the money-mongering bully it has sadly become.

Especially as many of them are unable to work regular jobs for disability and other reasons, it¡¯s very disturbing to me that YouTube takes advantage of them so much, a plaque doesn¡¯t pay the bills or buy food. 
If YouTube were to recognize these things as a problem and detriment to themselves as well as their content creators, and made the appropriate changes, I would be happy to remain loyal, I might even upgrade to premium because I¡¯d know that my money would be well spent and helping content creators be able to support themselves with all the hard work they do for their channels, as well as the honest, fair and caring people in the YouTube company.

I¡¯m not able to call or consult with your company even to find out what the hold up is. I¡¯m asking for your help now¡­if this were to be read! What can we do together to help get my Channel out there? I take all the Creator classes you¡¯ve offered, I have a YT coach and I post alot of material. It doesn¡¯t make logical sense why my videos won¡¯t run. Supercarblondie even tried to help me out by doing a video feature on me. That didn¡¯t work either. She was as surprised as I am that the YT algorithm won¡¯t run my work. I went to TikTok for their support and they embraced my work immediately. What can I do for YouTube to get my videos pushed out? Please share your recommendations and further insight as to how I can get some YT support! 

In addition, I noticed the SHORTS videos no longer allow for the Thumbmail to be selected. What happened to the option to change it? I need that feature for my SHORTS to be restored. 

How come we can¡¯t use more than 15 seconds of audio sound for SHORTS either? The videos are not very good when the song stops just as the video gets going. Please give us more sound time like TikTok does. Makes for a much better polished product.

I appreciate your help and for asking for feedback. I look forward to your response. Thank you so much!",17.12.5,mixed,

1,4.4,"Youtube can abuse their power as the undisputed monopoly leader of video sharing platforms whereby they control what can be seen, what can¡¯t be seen, how hard or easy something is to find, in a world where virtually everything from entertainment to political commentary is shared through YouTube.

They have a responsibility to maintain the facade that they care about true freedom of expression of the person, and that to impose ANY restriction or gall-given penalty to even a reasonable-appearing video, comment, statement that doesn¡¯t contain any extremely vulgar material like porn or extremely gory material, would be like robbing someone¡¯s entitlement to speak. 

We could argue all day what Private Privileges Youtube has a business but when you control a grand majority of how the world shares, comments, and distributes information, and further that you control the ability to change people¡¯s perceptions of issues by hiding certain things, emphasizing others things, you have a high implied responsibility to not abuse the sacred trust that people of the world willingly give you.

It is unforgivable that material shared on this platform that disputes common opinions on matters of public interest can be effectively hidden per vague and extremely far reaching de-monetizing and de-emphasizing powers, which is relevant ESPECIALLY during times like today, where even videos debating COVID-19 will be swiftly crushed, demonetized, de-emphasized, effectively hidden as a product of YouTube¡¯s unlimited power to do all of this and NOT have to disclose it to the general public and encourage debates on their ability to do this. People have an uncanny trust in Youtube, a trust that I think they should reevaluate. 

People trust Youtube NOT to over-broaden what they consider to be reprehensible or Censorable speech in their community guidelines.

People trust Youtube NOT to exercise unsubscribing people from channels without their knowledge.

People trust Youtube to maintain the facade that they care about creating a platform that encourages and preserves the freedom of people to express their beliefs, whether or not those beliefs are shackled by society or not. 

You have a duty to remain impartial. To NOT care about which opinions are being shared and in what volume, what popularity, and you Certainly have a duty to not use your power, as the controller of this platform, to manipulate which opinions get seen, hidden, demonetized, de-emphasized, destroyed, ANYTHING thereof that would make them any less important than other opinions.

Your duty is to regulate only what, at the highest threshold, would meet the test of extremity or vulgarity, to the degree that you would be protecting someone from physical harm or an even higher threshold test to establish emotional harm, before you should EVER consider censorship based on the most demonstrably obscene videos or comments, and to maintain the strict exercise of that power only in the most absolutely necessary of circumstances.

I do not believe for one second that Youtube has or will fulfill any of these duties, or at this rate, make any changes that will be for the pursuit of freedom of opinion, of expression and of the creation of an environment that does not segregate, incentivize or de-incentivize in any way, people from subscribing to any belief of their choosing, and that anything involving belief, that CLEARLY meets the guidelines of what a reasonable person would consider to not be vulgar or obscene, be allowed to be freely shared without the fear of YouTube¡¯s over-reaching intervention. 

After all I have seen, I cannot in my honesty say that I trust Youtube to not over-reach into the beliefs of their users through search results, through video penalties, through any other shady algorithms under the cover of darkness.

I don¡¯t trust them anymore. So I can¡¯t recommend them.",17.12.5,negative,

3,4.3,"A while ago, the iOS app started bundling notifications from the same YouTube channels. While this seems smart, shortening the notification bell list, I do think this feature lacks 1 option.

The same is done after I have watched a video. That option is missing in the ¡­ menu, when you bundle the notifications. Opening YouTube in a desktop browser does not bundle the notifications, but not always practical when you are on the go with only mobile devices. I know I can add the specific bundled videos to a playlist, but it would be preferred to be able to use the bell notifications as my to-do list. Please reconsider either a way to avoid the bundled notifications on mobile devices, or introduce ¡°hide this notification¡± to the specific notifications in the bundle. /Thomas",17.12.5,negative,

2,4.2,"I hate YouTube, I love the content and the creators. What bugs me is the sheer amount of ads and scummy practices. Ads are so intrusive it¡¯s hard to use the app, it requires near constant attention and babysitting just to finish a video. Gone are the days of letting a video play while you do some dishes or walk the dog. Back to back ads play multiple times in the middle of videos. Meaning you gotta stop what your doing, find your device, pray you even CAN skip the ads, then finally skip the ad and continue what you were doing. This happens multiple times per video, on every video. It¡¯s not enough to watch 2 at the beginning and end, no they gotta squeeze as much cash as possible out of your 7 minute experience. Ads also bar you from searching for another vid or clicking away, it completely blocks off the other videos unless you watch the ads or restart the entire app. The actual content of the ads is even worse, political content including topics like police brutality and misogynistic ads aimed at men. A good chunk of the ads are for mobile games, not only do they actually lie about the content they often use sexually explicit characters and sounds. Literal moaning and butt cheeks on screen is way too far. These can appear on any type of video, even without an account you¡¯ll see these ads. I¡¯m scared to even use this app in public, but I¡¯m more concerned about even watching a Minecraft video with my 4 year old cousin because at every turn, YouTube shoves disgusting advertisements in her face.
Another issue is the blocking feature, when I block a channel, that means I never want to see their content. I shouldn¡¯t be allowed to visit their channel or have it even appear to me. But for whatever reason that¡¯s not the case, YouTube channels I¡¯ve had blocked for months still pop up in my recommended videos. I¡¯ve blocked these accounts I truly don¡¯t understand why I¡¯m still seeing their content.

2,6.1,"When YouTube started, almost 20 years ago, it was one of the greatest things to ever happen on the internet.  The name ¡°YouTube¡± was supposed to be a description of its intention.  This was user-created television, broadcasting without a corporation or rich person trying to make money off of anyone, just pure creative efforts.  We should have known it couldn¡¯t last.  Capitalism ruins everything.  We should have known the creators would sell-out and the buyers would ruin it.  It didn¡¯t happen overnight.  At first, Google promised to keep YouTube user-created and they did.  For quite a while, you could see genuinely original, creative content, not cluttered with corporate media and infomercials.  Then it slowly began to change.  First it was ads.  They started off tastefully few and not smack dab in the middle of the content.  A bit at a time, probably by design, the ads crept into the content, multiplied, and chummed the waters for what killed YouTube¡­monetization.  Yeah, I know, ¡°But¡­what¡¯s wrong with getting paid for content?¡±  Well¡­nothing, as long as YOU are getting paid for your content.  No one paid the 1/10 of 1% of ad revenue for their views is getting paid for their content.  They are getting paid to keep their mouths shut.  Google makes BILLIONS off their content and pays out millions to content creators.  In what other creative industry is such an uneven payment system acceptable?  Now it¡¯s getting worse.  ¡°YouTube-TV¡±, which is a complete negation in terms, is a slap, spit, and punch in the face to those who loved YouTube.  Google (Alphabet) is hoping YouTube viewers are too young to remember the original YouTube, which was user-created and free of corporate sleaze, or too STOOPID to realize what a bad joke it is that a platform which originally provided regular, ordinary, non-rich people the chance to get their ideas and creativity noticed is now using the name of the platform to trick people into buying corporate ThemTube at RIDICULOUS prices, and defeat the original purpose and spirit of what was once YOUTube.

You used to be able to make a living on the platform doing what you loved but now you have to be very careful what you show and say or else you will be demonetized or removed. Even something as minuscule as quoting YouTube¡¯s policy directly is enough to get you demonetized. 

       You know it¡¯s bad when you can see the content creators struggle to make videos that are 100% kid friendly and devoid of any statements regarding the way Youtube perpetuates rather extreme ideals and forces it¡¯s creators to think the same way¡­ or be ousted from a job. 

       This isn¡¯t about free speech (while it¡¯s certainly a topic for debate), it¡¯s about YouTube¡¯s inability to take criticism from anyone. God forbid you expose them for lying about their policies like The Act Man did. One of the largest Youtubers who has been there for 7+ years. We never thought this would happen. Never even considered it a possibility, but now it states is dead in the face.

P.S. YouTube supports and feeds you scam ads with the intent to take your money by pretending to be somebody else (such as Mr. Beast!).

There are also the fake gameplay ads that are attempts to make themselves look cool that are so pathetic that they are the complete opposite of cool.

YouTube originally created them so people know which video is good or bad. 2. Bring back dislikes for comments. People need to know if comments are bad. Example: disliking comments that provide false information. 3. Button to report comments. No one likes comments that are rude and hurtful. Make it so that the reasons for reporting are the same for the reasons of reporting YouTube videos. 4. Ruby play button. This is for people with fifty million subscribers. 5. The community tab. It does exist on iPads, but it does nothing. I mainly watch YouTube on iPad, so please add it to iPad. 6. Remove double adds. They have no purpose and are whistling time for every viewer. 7. Reduce the number of adds in each video. The only adds in a video that needs to exist is at the beginning and the end. If the video is a short or less than a minute long, they should not happen. 8. Add a live now tab for the home page. Some people likes to watch livestreams. 9. Chill with the demonitization. People had Beed demonitised by just saying ¡°virus¡± and ¡°kill¡±.

The iPhone and iPad apps need a lot of work too. People expect them to work like the website but for some reason the ui is completely different. Similar to the Apple TV app, parity is more important that exploring new ideas. That¡¯s what beta branches are for. The website should act like the iOS and iPadOS apps. For instance, why can I still not view community posts on iPad? Why does rotating to landscape mode not full screen the content? I¡¯m glad they finally added Picture in Picture after many years of the feature being available system wide and YouTube ignoring it.

Livestreams are still awful. Look at twitch. Look at Ludwig¡¯s plug-in (which only works in browser, not iPhone, iPad or Apple TV) and implement the features that people want. YouTube livestreams are stagnating because they offer so few features. Twitch offers moderators an entire suite of tools. YouTube lets mods mute messages and that¡¯s it. A LOT of work is needed here.

YouTube has made strides in recent years but I can¡¯t help but feel a dedicated development team could easily build a much better video hosting service and have people mass migrate. YouTube needs to be careful if this.

I only give three stars because I use YouTube so much and I pay for premium, but I¡¯m not sure it even deserves three with all these issues.

They also barely enforce their community guidelines, especially in the case of quantum TV Who violated community guidelines such as¡­ 

(hate speech, external links, cyber bullying and harassment, ban evasion, harmful or dangerous content policies, Child safety policy, spam, deceptive practices, and scam policies.)  There is substantiated evidence that he violated all eight of those guidelines and YouTube just said ¡°Nah, we did a ¡®thorough investigation¡¯ jk we were lazy and we just don¡¯t care about the general situation, and we think he¡¯s innocent.¡± They should¡¯ve at least got them on the ban evasion, I mean that¡¯s what they did with leafy. he ban invaded and they banned him in a couple hours, so they clearly will enforce their policies whenever they feel like it.

The app specifically sucks because of how unoptimized it is.

Random closes also bother me.
Like I understand. If I go an hour without checking a video I had open, sure, I'm probably busy and it can close itself to save battery. Whatever.

1,6.3,"I have been using YouTube for years now, and recently it¡¯s become nearly unusable; not only the app but the website itself. Ive held my hopes up thinking they would start to care about the users to no avail. I¡¯ve deleted the app and now only use the web version when I need to. 

For starters, they obviously don¡¯t care about the user experience. The whole app has been transformed into a money making machine for google that barely rewards the creators that have made it what it is. I understand COMPLETELY that YouTube has to make money and that¡¯s okay, but it has become more than excessive recently. We¡¯re all aware of the notorious double ads and the concessions they make at the advertisers behest (like the removal of the dislike button, for example)  but it is my understanding that relatively little of this goes back to the video makers. They also have no problem shoving premium content down our throats. I¡¯ve gotten ads for YouTube premium more times than I can count, even though I have absolutely ZERO interest in purchasing it.

Moreover, the content itself is only getting worse because they don¡¯t care about the people the website relies on. They kill creativity by rewarding content farmed and uninspired reposts while leaving artists, animators, scientists, let¡¯s-players, and many other people from every corner of the website in the dust. Take one look at the trending tab and you¡¯ll understand what I mean. They try to force a family friendly environment, striking down and demonetizing anybody who dares to do something even as relatively mundane as saying curse words, which would be understandable if the website itself didn¡¯t have an age restriction and have a YouTube kids app focused specifically on keeping a family friendly environment. What is stopping them from allowing creative freedoms on the main website and keeping restrictions on the kids app? Why they spend so much time and effort destroying their platform is beyond me.

Personally, the worst part of the app and the final straw that made me delete it is the lack of customizability. Recently they¡¯ve begun implementing news, community posts, and shorts on their app among a few other things, NONE of which have any way to permanently disable as far as I can tell. In reality YouTube shorts are just a blatant rip-off of TikTok, and the community posts most commonly act as Instagram and Twitter knockoffs from poor quality channels I¡¯ve never seen and have no interest in. You can tell the community posts to stop recommending a channel, but I don¡¯t even see any difference it just comes right back filling my homepage with garbage posts I am powerless to remove. The poor excuse for a TikTok knockoff is the worst of the worst. I do not want anything to do with it, yet there is no way to turn it off. You can tell it to stop recommending them, click as many x¡¯s as you want, but none of it has any effect on the outcome. I¡¯m sure YouTube only implemented them because it keeps user retention up and it looks good on paper for advertisers, and I¡¯d like at the very least to tell them to stop and not come back. I used YouTube because I liked the YouTube format. If I wanted to use TikTok, Instagram, or Twitter I would do so.

There are so many other reasons why I am disappointed in the way YouTube has treated its platform recently, but my review is obviously already getting very long. Plus, it¡¯s not like google would listen to my requests or anyone else¡¯s. As we can clearly see from their recent actions they will do what they want and whatever makes the most money, at the cost of all of the apps users.",17.21.3,negative,ad disruption

I pay for Premium. I had the picture-in-picture feature as part of the testing program. Two days ago, I was asked to try other new features before they release it for everyone.   When I tried, I LOST my Picture-in-picture functionality. 

I talked to other people who had picture-in-picture, but didn¡¯t try the other new features, they told me they still have their picture-in-picture functionality. Which means I LOSR mine because I wanted to test another new feature. This would discourage me in the future to test new functionality. 

Also, why would YouTube not roll this feature out yet? It¡¯s not available to paid users - just users who signed up during the testing period.

There are also the fake gameplay ads that are attempts to make themselves look cool that are so pathetic that they are the complete opposite of cool.

Sometimes I¡¯m replying to a comment and I want to read the comment again so I have to copy and erase read the comment and then start a new one. The other major fail on YouTube¡¯s behalf is that you cannot tag people in comments! Please fix that! Sometimes I¡¯d like to tag a friend or sub. Very annoying. The live chat section on mobile also needs a ton of work. Add a feature where we can @ or reply to someone specific in the comments easily, instead of having to type out their whole name.

I would just like to say before I start that YouTube is an amazing app and there are no major problems. But there are a few things I want to address. First off, I don¡¯t really like the fact that YouTube changed the placing for the description and the comment section..it¡¯s very annoying in my opinion. It was much better when they weren¡¯t blocking the other recommended videos next to the video you¡¯re watching. Honestly, I don¡¯t really know why there is a whole new tab for them. It was better when it was connected to the video you¡¯re watching. Another thing is, why did you guys disable the option to see the dislikes on a video? That really annoys me, and it¡¯s kinda unnecessary. I understand that you guys don¡¯t want creators to be discouraged by the numbers, but some people like me want to see so they don¡¯t forget they disliked it. I liked YouTube a little better when you guys didn¡¯t change these minor things. Anyhow, YouTube is amazing and I will be continuing to use it. Have a good day! :)",17.20.3,mixed,

This double standard of allowing only certain communities to make blatant terrorist threats and insults towards Americans is disgusting. You do nothing even when I report the comments (ones that should be straight forwards , such as people advocating for the bombing of America, or beheading of innocent people). Extremists exist in all counties and religions. Yet your algorithm doesn¡¯t seem to think that these comments made towards Americans are inappropriate. Yet if I reply to any of those comments to, my comment is shadow banned? It¡¯s already been proven that Facebook intentionally allows this in their algorithm. Now YouTube is too. It¡¯s in your terms that certain social groups have extra protections. So it¡¯s a one way conversation where one group can verbally abuse the other? You¡¯re shooting yourself in the foot since Americans are the ones most likely to buy subscriptions, but your turning them into verbal punching bags to the world. Inappropriate comments need to be deleted whether they come from an American or someone from any other country. You ironically miss the fact that what you¡¯re doing is blatant bigotry. I refuse to buy a monthly subscription for a company that not only encourages extremism, but deletes the comments of those responding to those. Well excuse me if I am supposedly such a corrupt person to tell someone threatening to ¡°behead apostates¡± that they are crazy. I would say the same thing to anyone who said something like that, whether American or from any other country. Fix your algorithm, and find better people to screen comments. It¡¯s sickening that the people who stand of for social equality for all, such as myself, are silenced in favor or people who make blatant threats. And how are Muslims considers a ¡°protected minority¡±? Are you not aware that there are over a billion in the world? They are not a minority. That¡¯s just tone example for one group you allow free reign to make whatever comments. Bad people come from all countries, and the bad comments need to be deleted no matter where they¡¯re from. Deleting only the ones from Americans is absurd. I have no problems with any race or religion as a whole. I have friends and family from all walks of life. I am multi racial myself. But I am disgusted by your double standard policies. Ever considered that turning Americans into verbal punching bags to the world might have extremely negative long term results? 
At the moment I¡¯ve been reporting a comment from someone from Russian threatening to bomb the US. Apparently that¡¯s ok with YouTube because they won¡¯t take the comments down. Yet if I spend one seconds replying to the disgusting comments with ¡°you¡¯re crazy¡±, YouTube suddenly manages it figure out how to delete MY comment in 2 seconds. Comments with threats of violence need to be deleted asap. But YouTube and Facebook have this sick mindset that  it only counts as inappropriate if it comes from an American. Violent posts need to be deleted no matter where the person lives. YouTube is a perfect example of what¡¯s wrong with cancel culture. They are openly bigoted because they admit straight up in their terms of conditions that certain communities are better and allowed to post whatever they want, no matter how vile and violent. Most people in this world are good. But someone YouTube can¡¯t comprehend that the small handful of bad people in the world can come from any country, not just the US. The constant blatant threats towards Americans is tiring. Btw I¡¯m not even going out of my way to find this stuff on politicos videos. I don¡¯t even watch videos related to politics.

The following are gripes about the platform in general, not just this iOS app. My rating would still be 1 star just for the above reason.

Too many adverts. I get they're pushing the subscription model but it costs WAY too much! Also since there's so many ads, why are all successful content producers having to get sponsorships or ads in video. Am I to believe Google is fleecing the content producers as well as the content consumers?

Disproportionate number of ads for Google owned products and services. I get that it makes financial sense since it's free to advertise on a platform you own but it's not fair to other advertisers and from a viewer's perspective, 100 ads for the Google Pixel 6 is just really annoying.

I understand some videos are withdrawn by the owners but I am talking about 50 playlists hundreds of videos. Then I am offered playlists that keep including videos I do not want to watch. YouTube¡¯s computer selection does not understand that watching a video does not mean I want to see it often or again. I may need to keep videos that I seldom watch as a reference for future study. My playlists are in alphabetical for play back, but when I want to add another video they are no longer in alphabetical order. I have hundreds of playlists in my library. This makes YouTube unreliable as a study, research and production tool. The You Tube app fails frequently. If I pause a video it will not restart. Often this is relayed to advertisements stopping my iPad, Apple TV and Samsung TV which are all connected. The iPad may start but not Apple TV and Samsung TV. My comments are frequently censored and quickly deleted, will not load Error 404, or my keyboard is frozen. YouTube is involved in political censorship and it applies censorship laws that are not in the public interests. Freeze frame dims the image and graphics block the image preventing one from reading maps, diagrams and details. This is annoying and a failure of operation. It is my understanding that one of the highest ratings of community interest is pornography, yet YouTube responds to a minority of complaints and totally bans it. I am currently in Thailand where pornography is against Thai Law, but in Australia it is limited to toxic sites that shut down and/or scam viewers.

Always been a very heavy consumer of YouTube videos but I¡¯m rapidly reducing my time on the application as I am fed up with wasting 2-3 minutes for a 15 minute long video¡­

Their solution is to pay $20aud per month for youtube premium? That¡¯s insulting! You can pay less for all other streaming services and get access to a library of processionally made and funded shows and movies but on YouTube all you get for that amount of money is no ads, ability to download videos and YouTube music which nobody even uses?

YouTube is great and is such an entertaining place to go when you are bored, and there are tons of different videos to choose from, I always go to YouTube when I am bored and watch my favorite YouTubers, my friend is a YouTuber, though she does not has that much subscribers, her videos (and her cousins videos, they all have a YouTube channel together) are so entertaining and so funny. I also want to say that if you don¡¯t have much subscribers or likes, it doesn¡¯t matter because people have their different opinions, but if you like to do something then do it and post it, though in my opinion your should never ever upload anything bad or inappropriate, that¡¯s why I didn¡¯t give YouTube 5 stars, I gave them 4, because some people post things that are not appropriate and it effects people¡¯s brains, so in my opinion, if you like to make videos inappropriate and upload them don¡¯t, because you don¡¯t want to bully people or get into people¡¯s brains, so keep it to your self and if you want subscribers and likes from those inappropriate videos just make videos that are appropriate and then you can start getting subscribers and likes. It¡¯s your choice of what to upload on YouTube, but if you want our world to be a better place then don¡¯t make our world amazing make everyone happy, kind, everything amazing, yes we have our ups and downs, but we are all family and we all need to care and make everyone happy and nice and make our world a better place.

The only way is to like the video, and find it in you ¡°liked¡± video playlist. Its not a problem on iphone. Its an ipad bug. Downgrade from 3.5 to 3 stars. 

Edit 2: Sometimes you want to view the normal/recommended videos as a non user because i get tired of the same recommendations. i find mostly food videos when im not logged in. When i decide to log in to like a video ithrough the yt app), i get sent out of the video and back to my own homepage. 
 i want to reset my recommendations!! 
 A half star up for finally being able to perma-set your video preferences such as playing in highest quality on all videos. 

 Edit: None of the changes have been made so it is still 3 stars, and now there is more. This one is a bit less, so i wont deduct a star from it: When you comment while watching a video, and the video autoplays to another, you cant send off the comment you were making! 

 There is a need for studioplatform. Especially on Ipad. Im forced to go to the app based version on ipad, but at the same time it lacks the entire studio platform, including the ability to change settings under COPPA, not to mention it took me quite a while to even find the regulations for it. Not good. 1 star down. I personally think it should also have room for general settings, such as autosetting highest resolution or autosetting subtitels. It quickly gets annoying. 1 star down.

They¡¯re also finding new and creative ways to stick ads in front of your face, which is deplorable.  Recently, when you double-click to back up 10 seconds to rewatch something, you have to watch a stupid ad first. They also stick right right at the end of videos, also. I watch mostly on my cell phone. It¡¯s to bad there¡¯s not an effective ad blocker for cell phones.
One last stupid change they made along with others, is it used to be when you made a comment it dropped right below the person you were commenting responding to. Your comment was actually intended slightly, to make it easy to figure out who you were responding to. It was easy to follow the conversation with that particular person. Now your comment usually goes somewhere else, like to the end of the comments, so people have to scroll up and find out who you¡¯re responding to to read their comment. So ridiculous!
Who¡¯s making these decisions at YouTube/ Google? Go back to the old way. It was better. Any comment you want to automatically delete, you should TELL THE PERSON who made it.

All I had to do is log in to Best Buy and get the gift card, give him the number on the card and the hook up would then be completed. I did that and he apologized saying it was $200 not the $100. I got suspicious and called Best Buy¡¯s fraud department. Of course they had no such deal with YouTube. I contacted my credit company and stopped. Payment. 
Obviously YouTube has the problem and scammers are aware of it. Then to add to the problem, YouTube had charged the card that I had to cancel and I still couldn¡¯t talk to anyone to start my service.

The app has a great community. There¡¯s a lot of creativity available, and the actual creators are the main reason I still like this app.

¡­yikes

You guys need to stop treating your community, the only reason people like your app, like garbage.

-You removed the dislike counter, claiming it was to ¡°protect small creators¡± (let¡¯s be real here, if anything, it was because the bigger creators bribed you into it), making it hard to separate videos that are legit and videos that are a waste of time.
-another crappy thing that YOU did that is currently destroying small creators: ranking by views

4,5.18,"Firstly, I spend a ton of time on this app. There are some really awesome content creators that I watch and enjoy, and YouTube makes it really easy for them to do what they love while making some money.

However, the structure of the app can be really annoying and buggy, and Google keeps adding and removing features that no one wanted changed.

For example, pretty much everyone hates the removal of the dislike button¡ªa change no one asked for.
Just recently they changed the way you can like videos when you¡¯re in full screen mode, and it makes it twice as hard to do so now since the buttons are smaller and you have to carefully tap the screen without swiping AT ALL (lest you pull up the recommended) to bring up the like/dislike menu. Again, something no one asked for.
I¡¯m constantly getting ads I have already asked not to see or have reported to be scams, and the playlist feature is very buggy and will often add videos to playlists I didn¡¯t put them in. They did, however, fix the visual bug saying a video is in a certain playlist when it actually isn¡¯t, but it will still end up in the wrong ones sometimes.

Overall, the YouTube as a platform is awesome, but the layout of the app can be pretty frustrating.

There somewhat appears to be an issue when it comes to the general quality of some content on here. I¡¯m not talking about personal taste or what should or shouldn¡¯t be on the website and app but the literal quality or resolution of videos. 
 I¡¯ve been using the offline videos function to some extent and I¡¯ve noticed since the last two or three software updates a noticeable decline in the quality of offline playlists. Used to be that the max resolution you could save videos within the app was 720p. Now it appears to be up to 1080p in the settings and that¡¯s all good. Now though trying to save entire playlists from some channels appears impossible at such resolution at the videos go down to 480p if not 360p. Please correct this if and when possible thanks! 
 Another quality video issue I¡¯ve noticed is with 4k60 HDR content. I¡¯m using an iPhone 13 pro max for most of my YouTube consumption and the highest resolution available on such device is 480p60 HDR while the same videos on a 4K TV with HDR capabilities can go up to the full video resolution/experience.

BUG introduced in version 17.19.2:

The iOS gesture navbar is not hidden during fullscreen video playback in the YouTube App. 

Permanent display of the navbar during video playback will cause damage to the OLED screen due to burn-in. Please fix asap.

Missing features / problems: 

1. No picture-in-picture support.

2. No way to search for videos within channels and playlists.

3. Too many ads. Premium bundled with Music and thus more expensive than movie streaming services.

4. HDR availability and resolutions depend on whitelisted device lists. Rarely updating the list leads to the odd effect that older phones get much higher HDR resolutions than the latest flagship model that is not only capable of displaying HDR, but it's hardware is also way better at it (more efficient CPU, GPU and display quality). Example: iPhone X supported high-res HDR. It took a long time for YouTube to support the iPhone 11 (Pro / Max). Same is now true for the iPhone 13 (Pro / Max).

It disturbs the content of the YouTuber and makes me want to delete the app. This needs to be fixed I hate it when it says ¡®retry¡¯ all of the time after five seconds of the video. I have the latest iPhone and the most recent update so this shouldn¡¯t be happening. This really needs fixed and I¡¯m sure most people will agree with me that this is so so so so so annoying. I just want to watch my videos on YouTube shorts without any glitches and annoying disturbances.

 Also there is way too many ads as well. I understand that you have to have adverts due to sponsoring but most of the time the same ones are played and it¡¯s every 10 seconds of a video. It is getting annoying now.

This is against our God given rights and it¡¯s no worst than what they did in the years 1400 or 1500 when they were burning books and authors that were revealing the truth about the cabal deep state families!!

Next, YouTube removed dislikes in the name of ¡°Giving Small YouTubers a voice¡± while simultaneously silencing the voices of users and preventing them from calling out bad videos, providing criticism, and even calling out clickbait. I should also mention the increased amounts of wrongful copyright strikes I have seen against many YouTubers, especially the meme channels, with many memes being muted because corporations want people to pay for things that they don¡¯t even want to make money off of, which again makes YouTube too commercialized.

Recently, a few updates back this app suddenly stopped working, it just kept showing ¡°Error loading, Tap to retry¡±, I thought my internet is down, I checked on Speedtest, and I had full speed internet, I then opened YouTube on safari and it opened with no issues, videos were playing on the browser just fine (but with lower quality), I went back to the app, reloaded, nothing, it didn¡¯t work, I thought something was up with the app, I checked if it was updated, and it was updated to the latest version, I restarted the app, but still it didn¡¯t work, I thought this requires a hard reset, I deleted the app and reinstalled it, didn¡¯t work. I thought something was up with my phone ( I have the latest iPhone 13 Pro), so, I restarted my phone, nothing. I checked online and someone said that resetting the network settings should work, I did that, I lost all of my saved Wi-Fi passwords, but after I reconnected to the network, it still didn¡¯t work. I thought I had some kind of restriction on my router that¡¯s stopping YouTube specifically from loading, I checked on other computers, It was working there. I tried connecting to my phone¡¯s cellular data network and it worked. I tried connecting to a VPN (while on Wi-Fi), and it worked. I thought something is wrong with my router, I requested my neighbor to give me his guest Wi-Fi¡¯s password and every other websites worked, apps worked, except this app. I have been waiting, thinking that someone will also have the same issue and the developers should push a new update, but it¡¯s been probably 100 versions since it has stopped working and it still doesn¡¯t work and it¡¯s apparent that I have lost my patience. I can send you a screenshot if you want a detailed analysis on whats going on. I haven¡¯t found any answers anywhere on the internet. As far as I am concerned, I haven¡¯t heard anybody having the same issue. It¡¯s getting extremely annoying and I am just unable to figure out what is the exact problem. I just hope someone from YouTube reads this and reaches out.
 TLDR, YouTube app doesn¡¯t load any videos when on Wi-Fi (without connected to the VPN), it surprisingly works when I connect to the VPN (absolutely any VPN), works when I connect to cellular data, works on the browser (safari/chrome). Wi-Fi router isn¡¯t blocking YouTube, I tried connecting to other Wi-Fi routers and it¡¯s the same issue. I tried absolutely every other standard procedure to force a reset, nothing works. Also, I forgot to add this, iPhone settings don¡¯t have any feature that blocks Wi-Fi internet to a specific app. Another weird thing that could help you debug the issue, if I am already logged-in on the app, I am able to load my account details, I am able to modify/edit any of my google account details, but none of the tabs at the bottom ¡°home¡±, ¡°shorts¡±, ¡°subscriptions¡± load any videos/thumbnails, just a simple message that says ¡°Error loading, Tap to retry¡±.

I should also mention the increased amounts of wrongful copyright strikes I have seen against many YouTubers, especially the meme channels, with many memes being muted because corporations want people to pay for things that they don¡¯t even want to make money off of, which again makes YouTube too commercialized.

'You can use others content as if you wanna react to it or make some edits'? NO! They dont do that around here! Look at this, I reacted to South Park episode clips, and my video got censored for it, but here we are, reacting to That Vegan Teacher and it still stays on the platform, not to mention they also removed the voice audio I had recorded for the video when I UPLOADED IT! Also, they allow bad people to roam around and about here but they terminate most of the great creators who are ACTUALLY trying to make a difference! Ahem, you wanna follow up with Republican politics? NOPE! They follow communism and they try to brainwash you as well. Also, there is no freedom of speech, anything you say about politics gets removed for no reason. Also, there is restricted mode for YouTube, but no SafeSearch. By the way, YOUTUBE! THERE ARE CHILDREN WATCHING VIDEOS ON THIS PLATFORM, WHY ARE YOU SHOWING THEM INAPPROPRIATE ADS?! Oh and take a look at this, they removed PiP from premium mode, how ridiculous! Oh, and there is a part 2 to this. We are going to be talking about YouTube kids. But it may be small. YouTube Kids is more trash than this website, you cant like OR dislike videos either, whats the point? You cant make your own videos, really? You can search up ""Killer Clown"", and get nothing, but you search up ""Clown"" and you FIND A KILLER CLOWN! Almost all of the videos shown upon the app are cringe. If you are under 12 years old, you are forced to be on YouTube Kids and watch cringy videos. Why does YouTube Kids even exist when YouTube has a restricted mode in the first place? It is possible that inappropriate videos can accidentally slip through YouTube Kids' video checking system. Everything is so limited for no reason too.

I subscribe to YouTube Premium.

With Premium that is obviously one of the features (locking and listening simultaneously).

2,5.1,"Over the years I feel like this app has gone downhill. It feels like no good decisions are being made, and bad ones keep getting made.

1. Double 20s unskippable ads seem to be the norm now. Sometimes the ads are even longer than the video you¡¯re trying to watch, which is one of the many issues that make the user experience worse. 

2. Removing dislikes was a horrible decision. There was already an option to disable the dislikes, there was no reason to enforce it other than to protect the companies. It doesn¡¯t help small creators like you said, which is just a blatant lie.

3. Having possibly the most stubborn decision makers and not caring about the fan base. Despite having so much backlash and complaints over these issues, none of these are getting removed, but more unnecessary changes keep being made. Susan Wojicki doesn¡¯t care about the users, they just want to get as much money as possible.

4. Overpricing of Youtube Premium. Not everyone¡¯s economic situation is great right now, so Premium is too expensive unless you use Youtube a ton. And to try and sell it more, they continue to make the free version as terrible as possible. But if someone can¡¯t buy it, then it just creates a miserable experience.

It¡¯s a shame that a greedy multi-billionaire company had to get their slimy hands on Youtube because this isn¡¯t gonna change any time soon, so the platform will just keep getting worse.",17.18.4,negative,ad disruption

2. No way to search for videos within channels and playlists.

3. Too many ads. Premium bundled with Music and thus more expensive than movie streaming services.

4. HDR availability and resolutions depend on whitelisted device lists. Rarely updating the list leads to the odd effect that older phones get much higher HDR resolutions than the latest flagship model that is not only capable of displaying HDR, but it's hardware is also way better at it (more efficient CPU, GPU and display quality).

Example: iPhone X supported high-res HDR. It took a long time for YouTube to support the iPhone 11 (Pro / Max). Same is now true for the iPhone 13 (Pro / Max).

First you messed with the display settings - no longer can I quickly change from 480p to 1080p. I have to dig through multiple menus to change my resolution - do you think your consumers are too stupid to know the difference between 480p and 1080p?
Secondly - you ruined landscape mode and how it interacts with comments. If you¡¯re looking at the comments and then the phone to landscape mode, now the comments stay. Who thought this was a good idea? Atleast give me the option to revert the app back to how I liked it.
Third - I frequently skip around in videos because the touch controls added another feature where you can skip around to bookmarked times in the video. I have no idea how this feature works and it happens accidentally all of the time and I lose my place. Please give me an option to revert this.
Fourth - it¡¯s really easy to bring up the information menu while in landscape mode. Simply tapping the screen accidentally in the wrong place on the screen brings up an info window on the right side and moves the picture all around and it¡¯s awful. This feature needs to go now.
Fifth - so many ads now expand the display window and eat up comments space. Not only that, but when the ad ends it then loses your place in the comments section. This is another awful feature. 
I would be a much happier user if you just took the app back 3 years in time. I honestly can¡¯t think of a single update in the last 3 years that you¡¯ve done that actually makes using the app better. Every update you push makes rumble and odysse look better and better.

I¡¯ve been thinking about that quote _a lot_ lately. 

At 4 o¡¯clock on May 4, 2022, I deleted the YouTube app on my two primary devices. I haven¡¯t tested the thing yet, but I imagine the account remains extant¡ªI still have other devices that can access the account.  As of this writing, I haven¡¯t returned to the app. 

A quirk of my personality requires that whenever I make a major change¡ªand I¡¯ve used some version of this app since my first iPhone, a now-ancient iPhone 4¨CI feel I must call my shot, like a player in a really _serious_ billiards game. If I don¡¯t call the shot, the effort doesn¡¯t count. 

And I take my New Year¡¯s Resolutions _very_ seriously, too, and I estimate I had already eliminated half of the channels to which I was subscribed on YouTube as of January 1, mostly the fan channels whose hosts have come to seek to build their own cults to lead and to mine cash from the virtual collection plate by stating some piece of popular culture is the either Best Ever, or that Hollywood is Burning, OMGWTF!

I¡¯m certain my blood pressure has lowered significantly in the five months I¡¯ve avoided these channels!  

But something nagging still remained. First were the repetitions of the same useless adverts for caches of survival food, the razors designed to remove hair from every crevice and curve from a man¡¯s body, and the screeching noises¡ªoh, how edgy!¡ªthat accompany adverts of a similar company who advertises a product that removes hair, but this time, from a woman¡¯s body!  Oh, I can¡¯t forget the vapid political ads¡ªsee the above text about pop culture cults!  At least, the ads suggesting I should hook up with a foreign bride seem to have disappeared!  I don¡¯t think I¡¯ve ever been influenced by any ad I¡¯ve seen on YouTube, except to hit the ¡°skip ad¡± button as fast as I possibly can!

That, and simple disgust. 

It¡¯s getting to the point where I would almost do violence to watch an ordinary glass cleaner ad!

This is friggin¡¯ YouTube, self-crowned masters of spacetime, if one believes the update details; and, surely, a better class of advertisers are ready to serve this market, right?

But, worse, there seems to be a stunted feeling in the videos and comments.  There¡¯s no growth.  The same people come on and off and crack the same jokes and yak about the same trivia and show off the same stuff, from five, seven, ten years ago.

Rarely, I find something that equals the aspirations of Edward R. Murrow¡¯s quote at the start of this missive. 

Rarely. 

The comment section is simply odious.  

And this is pure speculation, but I suspect that YouTube, like other platforms thrive off that kind of ick, even as it is evident that there are planned Bum¡¯s Rushes on mainstream news media. Maybe because baiting the trolls is the best YouTube can do.

Even if I happen upon a moderately positive environment, the app feels like a dead end, a thing to be played because not to play it makes the silences unbearable.  And I have many other and potentially more fruitful options to deal with _that_ problem. 

So, at minimum, a YouTube vacation¡¯s in order.  Even after only a day(as of this writing), I feel a little better¡ªand my phone no longer feels slimy!  I¡¯ve found alternate methods to access more than all the news and entertainment I want. 

Maybe I¡¯ll be back sometime, but I envision a much smaller channel footprint¡ªmaybe as few as ten channels, depending on the breaks.   But I¡¯m not sure if I¡¯d bet on that:  I felt the exact same way when I dropped basic cable over ten years ago.  I¡¯ve barely watched anything from _that_ source¡ªand even then, almost always languishing in waiting rooms¡ªsince I left¡­

3,5.6,"Hello. I am a long time fan of YouTube and seem to have noticed the YouTube shorts are not working as intended ever since the new update. I will give you a list of problems concerning YouTube shorts:

1. I can only like by double tapping. If I try to like it by pressing the like button once, it only pauses the video. This wasn¡¯t a problem now but it¡¯s making liking videos harder if I don¡¯t want to double tap

2. I can¡¯t read the comments. This spills to Number 1. When I click on the YouTube comments, it is not disabled, and I can even see the number how many comments are on. Yet unlike before the latest update, it just pauses the video, making reading comments impossible 

3. Getting out of YouTube shorts, it is impossible when I click on a short from my home page. When I try to hit the arrow that lets you out of YouTube shorts, it doesn¡¯t work. When I go to other tabs, and go back, it still won¡¯t let me out. It just keeps pausing and unpausing. I am forced to close my tab and start again. 

I am on YouTube on a phone, and this problem probably won¡¯t be on over devices. Yet this makes me want to avoid YouTube shorts to avoid getting stuck. I liked watching YouTube shorts and this problem makes it less enjoyable.
Please fix this problem soon.

2,5.5,"Unlike every other video app on iOS, YouTube refuses to implement a floating window (which has SDK support in iOS and is trivial to implement). This is even if you pay for a Premium account. The fact that it is trivial to implement leads me to believe YouTube is intentionally handicapping their app on iOS, for reasons I cannot fathom.
Then there is no back/forward button - there is a history of what you¡¯ve watched, so it will be trivial to implement, but if I accidentally click on another video, to get back to what I was watching takes many clicks.
For videos that are in multiparty series, there is no simple way to navigate back or forward through the episode list, at least I have not seen such a control.
Essentially the UI doesn¡¯t treat multipart series as a series, nor your history as a series, which you can go forwards or backwards through using a ¡°previous¡± and ¡°next¡± button.

Something that bothers me, and I would love to see it changed, is regarding ads. Listen, I have no problem with having ads on videos. That¡¯s what makes them free to watch! But sometimes, while watching a video, I will scroll down to see similar videos that I might want to watch next. If an ad comes on while I am doing this, a card will pop up over all the videos I was looking through. When I close that ad card, it brings me back up to where the video title is, and I have to scroll back to where I was. It¡¯s not horrible, but it happens a lot so I get annoyed. There¡¯s not really any reason to bring me back to the top after an ad.

Something else I dislike is that I don¡¯t get every notification I should. When someone replies to a comment I made, I sometimes don¡¯t get notified. I think it¡¯s even happened when my username was tagged on the reply. I would like to be notified because the only other way to see a reply would be to periodically check back to my comment under any video I¡¯ve commented on, which isn¡¯t really plausible. I would much rather get notified of replies that are directly to my comments than when someone else replies to the same comment I replied to (and I do get those kinds of notifications quite often).

Last thing I can think of is changing the format of the watch history. I don¡¯t like that the watch history displays above all of my playlists in the library page. I wish it was just a small tab you could click on, such as how the purchased tab or watch later tabs look. That¡¯s the only reason I keep watch history turned off. And I would like to turn it on, but that really bothers me.

I have to make sure I have the remote in hand at all times so I am ready to skip an ad. Heaven forbid you want to play some music while you do chores or take a shower.

They are really really overdoing it. Getting multiple ads every few minutes is outrageous. I just want to be able to put on something to watch or listen to and relax. Streaming boxes and Netflix are all the same. You have to babysit the remote.

Say for example, I was searching for a popular video game for a walkthrough, or something else, I don¡¯t need a freaking friday night funkin mod, I just want to see the game. Also, whenever I try to get back to the time of the video I was just on after closing the app for 10 seconds, it tends to be a bit, slow. What I mean is it takes a while for the video or ad to load, which shouldn¡¯t be a problem if you have internet, but still is. Another thing is that, when I close the app, I may be doing something to help someone for a couple of seconds, but when I get back on my phone, the video I was just watching had gone away. This is a problem for people with, not that good of a memory. The final thing is spoilers. I think that people shouldn¡¯t be allowed to spoil movies when they make a short. If you could add a feature where people could report videos for spoilers (Signed in or not), so that other people wouldn't get spoiled. This is a problem with very popular movies where people just spoil the ending without a care in the world because they only care about themselves. So could you please update the app and make sure the video in the category is correct, closing the app for a couple seconds doesn¡¯t close out the video, being able to report spoilers, that would be a great update for the future.",17.17.4,negative,ad disruption

Second of all:
Double standards
The double standards on ads vs creators is disgusting, it shows how greedy Google is. An ad can show fully exposed breasts for some hentai game and it¡¯ll be allowed, but a creator can show a character with larger breasts that are covered by clothes yet they get demonetized, plus the fact that censored nudity is somehow bad despite the fact that¡¯s what censor bars are literally for, the moderation is horrible.

And finally..

The bots.
I don¡¯t think I need to explain this too much, the bots are horrible, someone can say something innocent but YouTube deletes it, yet bots can spam links to horrible videos or mock tragedies or a popular creator loosing a family member (such as the situation with Markiplier¡¯s niece) and never get punished until their mass-reported

Also, the problem with bots in the comment section of YouTube videos is RIDICULOUS. YouTube has not even acknowledged that there is a problem. It really needs to be fixed.

1,5.2,"Hi YouTube. I hope you¡¯re having a good day. I am wondering why you guys haven¡¯t fixed the HD issue within the YouTube app. When I set the Video Quality Preferences in Settings to ¡°Higher quality¡±, I only get 480p. After setting the video quality in ¡°Advanced¡± on the YouTube video to 1080p or 1440p, it stays stuck on 480p, even when I jump around in the video trying to get it to buffer. This makes for a very unenjoyable experience, and I am not the only one facing this issue. Why not just have an option in ¡°Video Quality Preferences¡±, where you can set it to 1080p or 1440p, so any video will load at that resolution, no matter how long it takes to buffer?? I would rather have a slowly buffering HD 1080p video, than a fast buffering SD 480p video. Please fix this, YouTube. Thanks, -Jarod
Edit: I was able to fix this issue by setting the resolution I wanted in the video, (in YouTube video> cog wheel > advanced> 1080p) then closing out the video, and opening the video again. At least there¡¯s that, but it would be so much easier having the auto HD. What¡¯s more is my wifi and my phone buffered the video just fine on 1080p, when it auto set ¡°higher picture quality¡± to 480p.",17.17.4,negative,

Before Covid-time I occasionally watched YouTube, but not too much because I was very busy playing in a whole bunch of ensembles.  That all stopped with the shutdown.  YouTube saved me, truly.

I found the channel of a flutist I¡¯ve known for 20 years.  I also went on a country music journey, revisiting music I loved and learning so much that I never knew.  Then, I travelled, virtually to SW Scotland, home of some of my ancestors.  YouTube suggested a channel that was actually in the part of Scotland from where they emigrated to the US.  I also travelled virtually to a homestead in Vermont.

If you don¡¯t know what Youtube is, Youtube is a video, streaming, and watching site and app.       Everyone knows you can¡¯t bring your big pc in the car or other places. So, the creators of Youtube decided to create an app to make it even more accessible to a whole other group of people. This app consists of trillions of different videos, and thousands of genres. You can watch your favourite creators stream, upload videos, and more. It has a simple, clean interface so that younger and older audiences can easily get around! Youtube is generally made for audiences 12+. 
Youtube is also filter free, so your child can get exposed to curse words and other inappropriate behavior. However, there are moderators trying their best to put out videos that are safe and not extremely inappropriate to the point everyone¡¯s eyes need holy water.

1. Bring back dislikes. This is one that should be back. YouTube originally created them so people know which video is good or bad.

2. Bring back dislikes for comments. People need to know if comments are bad. Example: disliking comments that provide false information.

3. Button to report comments. No one likes comments that are rude and hurtful. Make it so that the reasons for reporting are the same for the reasons of reporting YouTube videos.

4. Ruby play button. This is for people with fifty million subscribers.

5. The community tab. It does exist on iPads, but it does nothing. I mainly watch YouTube on iPad, so please add it to iPad.

6. Remove double adds. They have no purpose and are whistling time for every viewer.

7. Reduce the number of adds in each video. The only adds in a video that needs to exist is at the beginning and the end. If the video is a short or less than a minute long, they should not happen.

8. Add a live now tab for the home page. Some people likes to watch livestreams.",17.16.4,mixed,ad disruption

2,4.26,"Sometime in the past few months YouTube started throttling connection speeds on iPhones. I¡¯ve tested on multiple different iPhones in multiple locations both on Wi-Fi and on cellular. It always throttles to around 15mbps.
You can check your connection speed by going to the YouTube app>touch your account icon in too right corner>settings>general>toggle on ¡°stats for nerds¡±. When watching a video, click the 3 dots in the tops right corner and select ¡°stats for nerds¡±. I¡¯m pretty sure anyone with an iPhone will see it is throttling. It does not throttle on other devices. I get up to 140mbps on other devices.
This change makes loading videos that are 1440p60 slower and scrubbing through them makes it load every time. This did not used to be an issue because the connection was typically 120mbps on my iPhone.
In addition, this bandwidth cap imposed by YouTube prevents you from even being able to watch something in 2160p60 HDR. In fact, that option doesn¡¯t even exist in the quality settings on videos that are published in this quality. The max quality YouTube will allow on iPhone for 60fps HDR videos is 480p. What a joke.
Finally, iPhones don¡¯t have 3840x2160 resolution screens, but choosing this quality and allowing your phone to downscale to its max resolution still provides better quality than just going with your displays max resolution due to the way YouTube¡¯s encoding and compression work. Since they¡¯ve capped the connection speed, it is no longer possible to watch a video that requires more than 15-17mbps without buffering or sacrificing quality.
I have not tested this on any mobile device besides iPhones, but I am curious to see if it is the same on iPads and to test if they also throttle android device connections. If they only throttle iOS devices, it would be quite the discovery.",17.16.4,negative,bad performance

I could go on a rant about how much of a problem all of this is but I only have one complaint that I think really needs to be changed asap before people stop using the website/app all together. Search results. When searching for something specific to watch, Youtube is SUPPOSED TO show you everything relevant to what you just searched. i.e. if you look up ¡°Funny dogs¡± it should show you a bunch of different videos that have to do with funny dogs. However, the recommendation system is interfering with search results. I could look up funny dogs and and get something in my search results that is totally unrelated to funny dogs, like Beyonce for example. Totally unrelated, but because I also watch Beyonce music videos, they put that in my search results recommending that video to me. Why? If I was looking for anything related to that I would have searched for it. Moral of the story, there should not be videos related to what I like to watch, or more so what the algorithm THINKS I like to watch, rather than what I literally just searched up. This ruins the entire point of searching for something, especially when the filter for search is always set to ¡°relevance¡±.

If peoples parents show up and check their kids history and the kid doesn¡¯t know how to remove from history the kid is gonna be in big trouble when the video wasn¡¯t even supposed to show up.

3,4.21,"Generally a good app to watch YouTube videos but the TVOS version that runs on AppleTV hardware is a mess.  

The app enables subtitles at will without the user requesting them , rather than letting the user set when a subtitle comes on. Been that way for a year or so without sign of getting fixed. Not a hard computer science problem; my suspicion is the Google engineers think viewers are monolingual and if you like watching things without subtitles their algorithm to guess what you need is just wrong. 

Hiding the subscribe button one more level deep in the tvOS version can¡¯t be good to subscription rates. Now one has to setup up into the icon menu and select the channel name vs up to the icons and selecting the 3 buttons to see the thumbs ratings buttons and the subscription button. 

But then the interface sometimes locks where you can select up to the icon menu but the remote won¡¯t let you move sideways to get to the ¡­ menu.  You have to select DOWN and then UP a second time and then you can move sideways.  Odd. 

And the ¡°recommended¡± videos list, oh what a disaster. It alleviates the fear of Google knowing all because they clearly cannot track the basics, at least in YouTube. Recommending videos I habe already watched (based on my historical view record but especially when the red progress bar on the thumbnail indicates I¡¯ve watched it) - what is that about?  And no way to tell the app/algorithm ¡°I hate this channel or subject matter, stop offering it¡± (you have to use a full computer with web browser to do that) just means that the ¡°recommended¡± list is half full of things I already have seen or just cannot stand. (Why the algorithms keep thinking I¡¯d like some of those subject matters is beyond me.). 

To help the creators and the algorithm it would be ideal if the tvOS viewer can signal with the remote (a learning remote in my case so don¡¯t rely on apple only swipe or long press nonsense in the IR signal ) - signal easily and quickly with least amount of remote presses :
1) thumbs up down on video (the video itself , not the subject of the video or the channel )
2) subscribe 
3) dislike the subject (don¡¯t recommend this subject ever again )
4) dislike this channel (don¡¯t recommend anything by this channel ) 

Then allow users to manage their disliked channels and subjects lists via the full computer web page. 

And for gods sake let me set subtitles off and that applies always unless I manually turn on subtitles or specify for which languages I want subtitles. 

Along with that goes the - don¡¯t translate the titles from native languages to my language - it me always into thinking the video is in my language and just results in a bad user experience.",17.15.2,negative,

Can you do us a favor and give us the peace of mind knowing we can scroll without the cost? I have a few recommendations on what can be done:

1: Add a captcha.

2: purge reposting accounts.

3: add a limit to the amount of the same video someone can post.

4: work with anti-bot software.

5: add an account verification process to block bots from logging into accounts.

The exact same things and worse can and have been said by creators on the left yet they¡¯ve not been demonetized/banned (shadow or otherwise). 

I kept my premium account because maybe YouTube really is just trying to clean up the app.. and I can get behind that because it¡¯s not a publicly owned company and they can do what they want with their company, they can be as biased as they want and can continue to enforce the one-sided ban hammer.. even if it¡¯s detrimental to free speech and a well balanced conversation that lets the public see every side of an argument and let¡¯s the best ideas be shown and celebrated and the worst ideas organically forced into the shadow realm. Instead we get censorship.

But then YouTube drops PiP? That¡¯s a VERY useful tool when studying (I¡¯m a nurse and PiP is incredibly useful when watching nursing channels teach certain things that I¡¯m working on while furthering my licensing in school), working, or just when you want to watch a video while doing something on a different app. WHY would an app do that, why would they get rid of something useful that benefits the users of the app¡­..?

I¡¯ve cancelled my premium account so I¡¯m letting it run to the end of it¡¯s current billing period and then I will be using the YouTube app much less. The price for premium just isn¡¯t justified if all I can do is stream censored video when the app is open or listen to it in the background. Prices slowly go up or remain the same but access to useful app features goes down? How does that make sense.. 

If Picture in Picture support is brought back, I can use that and I can subscribe to premium once again.

Look at this, I reacted to South Park episode clips, and my video got censored for it, but here we are, reacting to That Vegan Teacher and it still stays on the platform, not to mention they also removed the voice audio I had recorded for the video when I UPLOADED IT! Also, they allow bad people to roam around and about here but they terminate most of the great creators who are ACTUALLY trying to make a difference! Ahem, you wanna follow up with Republican politics? NOPE! They follow communism and they try to brainwash you as well. Also, there is no freedom of speech, anything you say about politics gets removed for no reason. Also, there is restricted mode for YouTube, but no SafeSearch. By the way, YOUTUBE! THERE ARE CHILDREN WATCHING VIDEOS ON THIS PLATFORM, WHY ARE YOU SHOWING THEM INAPPROPRIATE ADS?! Oh and take a look at this, they removed PiP from premium mode, how ridiculous! Oh, and there is a part 2 to this. We are going to be talking about YouTube kids. But it may be small. 

YouTube Kids is more trash than this website, you cant like OR dislike videos either, whats the point? You cant make your own videos, really? You can search up ""Killer Clown"", and get nothing, but you search up ""Clown"" and you FIND A KILLER CLOWN! Almost all of the videos shown upon the app are cringe. If you are under 12 years old, you are forced to be on YouTube Kids and watch cringy videos. Why does YouTube Kids even exist when YouTube has a restricted mode in the first place?

Every video has about a hundred or so bot comments, some post violent/sexual content but of course YouTube doesn¡¯t care about that.

However, action needs to be taken toward paid sponsors within videos, and they should not be allowed; but I understand that¡¯s a reach.
 So, this mainly applies to millionaire YouTubers abusing paid sponsorships, and I hope YouTube makes their fair share from their platform being used to make business connections.

5,4.12,"Gentlemen,

YouTube has become¡ªwith the two exceptions of ¡°live sports¡± broadcasts and ¡°classic automobiles¡± programs¡ªthe ONLY CHANNEL I WATCH!!  I¡¯m able to get current events/news from a variety of sources, along with tutorials in:  Philosophy; Economics; History; Mathematics; Science; both English and foreign Languages ¡­ and, of course, even Comedy when I need a break to relax my brain (not to mention several ¡°bikini models¡± vlogs which I appreciate thoroughly and enjoy immensely)!!  ;D

However, I have been hearing a great deal recently about YouTube¡¯s ¡°algorithms,¡± ¡°shadow-banning,¡± ¡°collusion with the Left,¡± &c., which DOES worry me some, and sincerely hope is overblown rhetoric; yet I feel I have a certain ¡°duty¡± [as a J.D./Ph.D. and First Amendment advocate] to diligently keep-an-eye-out for ¡­ just in case.  I¡¯m sure you understand my motivation; non?

Regardless, and as of this moment, YouTube is, by far and away, my hands-down-VERY-FAVORITE platform/publisher/channel/&c. EVER!!  Thank y¡¯all for the opportunity to communicate directly, and I look forward to supporting YouTube for many years to come.  With my warmest regards, I shall remain

Very truly yours,

~Dave

1,4.11,"YouTube started as a beacon of hope for all those fleeing mainstream cable or seeking to expand their perspectives or learn actively on the go. Lately, it has experienced a harrowing sequence of updates which have degenerated it into a shadow of its former self: restrictions on free speech, agressive demonetization of promising content by faulty algorithms without the opportunity for appeal, as much as 3 advertisements at multiple points in videos¡ªeven on those under 1 minute¡ªas well as multiple banners occupying much of your screen at any given moment, many of which contain outright pornographic material (reporting them either goes nowhere or creates change far too late)¡­ The list goes on! One should only surf google for a few seconds to find abundant criticism of many of the latest decisions made by YouTube, amongst no praise whatsoever.

 It was almost a year ago that YouTube promised PiP would be available for free to everyone.

I have reported and blocked these ads many times but YouTube keeps targeting me with them. Also, the sheer number of ads on each video, the length of some of these ads, and the removal of the skip ad button when using Google Chrome on my computer are abusive. Often, a 10 minute long video will be interrupted by hour long ads, or 10 ads on a two minute long video, none of which can be skipped. I suspect this is a deliberate strategy by YouTube to attempt to force me to pay for YouTube Premium, which I will never do.

But, beyond that, you've got a simple feed based app that has been executed extremely poorly. The ranking is garbage -- accidentally click on a video of a pig eating an apple? Pig and apple videos for days! DAYS! And, on top of that, they can't even get basic feed UX right... Oh, did you tap in to a playlist thinking you'd preview all the videos within that playlist? Nope, we're playing the very first video, immediately, and then we'll show you recommended videos not a part of the playlist. If you go back to play something else then the whole feed changes because they refresh the recommendations on the previous screen. Serendipitous discover is one thing, but forced randomness through a pile of garbage is another. Good luck trying to find something specific. 

Obvs this review will get buried under the myriad of other reviews praising the content that gets uploaded to YouTube, not realizing the content exists elsewhere in the infinite number of other feed-based video apps; nor that this specific app didnt even create the videos.

It¡¯s the only entity on You Tube that I can complain to. They never answer me. July 11, 2021 Dear You Tube Support, I have been a paying You Tube Premium member for nearly two years. On July 1, 2021, I discovered the following: 1. You wrongfully terminated my You Tube account. 2. You gave me no notification of this termination, or any reason for it.  I have not violated your rules. Why did you terminate my account? 3. You stuck me with a new You Tube account. It does not include my comments, playlists, notifications, subscriptions, and ¡°Library¡± information. I have complained to you about this numerous times. You have never responded. On July 11, 2021, I discovered the following: 1. If I try to watch a video on You Tube, you oblige me to watch an advertisement. I am not supposed to be shown ads as a paying You Tube Premium member. 2. I have no access to You Tube Music. You Tube Music is part of my You Tube Premium membership. 3. By forcing me to watch ads, and denying me access to You Tube Music, you are engaging in criminal fraud. I expect you to do the following, immediately: 1. Restore my You Tube account. My account must include my comments, playlists, notifications, subscriptions, and ¡°Library¡± information. This account is known as ¡°gmail¡±. Do not expect me to be satisfied with the wrongful ¡°icloud¡± account that you imposed on me, without my permission. 2. Do not force me to watch advertisements. 3. Restore my access to You Tube Music. Again, I am a paying You Tube Premium member. I have been so for nearly two years. You have been engaging in false, deceptive, and wrongful practices against me since March of 2020. I have witnessed you engaging in such conduct against other You Tube customers. Stop running a criminal enterprise that abuses and defrauds the public! Sincerely, Andrew L. Roller

Dear Apple,

I have noticed something.  At your Apple ¡°App Store¡±, at the top of your main page, you always featured the most popular apps.  You featured them in a box.  The box was called, ¡°Now Trending¡±.  YouTube was always in this box.

Then, YouTube began to slip in popularity.

Recently, you stopped showing the ¡°Now Trending¡± box.  You replaced it with a box that you call, ¡°Our Favorites¡±.  Of course, ¡°Our Favorites¡± can be whatever you want it to be.

What have you put at the top of ¡°Our Favorites¡±?  YouTube!  This despite YouTube¡¯s fall in popularity.

The ¡°Now Trending¡± box has returned.  However, you have demoted it to a lesser part of your main page.  Is YouTube in the ¡°Now Trending¡± box?  No!  TikTok is, but not YouTube.

Modernly, TikTok has replaced YouTube in popularity.

YouTube is owned by Google.  It is not owned by Apple.  So why are you, Apple, giving unearned publicity to YouTube?

America¡¯s government is already concerned about collusion between Big Tech companies.  Apple and Google are the epitome of Big Tech.

I could understand your favoring YouTube if you owned YouTube.  But you don¡¯t.  Please stop favoring YouTube!  You are making yourself ( and Google ) targets for Anti-Trust legislation.  YouTube does not need unearned publicity from you.

One such choice was the implementation of the YouTube shorts feature. 
Although I understand the want the drive up view times because of competition  with Tik Tok, I find that for many viewers like me often fall victim to the addictive nature of this new algorithm. One reason why I choose to not use Tik Tok is for this same exact reason. I spend hours and hours on it needing to stay put constantly swiping to see the next video. And now with every video having nothing but YouTube shorts right after it keeps me constantly on the app swiping and swiping.

1. Videos presented have truncated title for no reason. You have to launch them to realize you¡¯re not interested.

3. There is no way to designate a next video you¡¯d like to watch. Podcasts have this as a standard function. YouTube doesn¡¯t. 

4. Advertisements burst in mid sentence. Could help if when the video restarts it backs up 2 or 3 seconds to catch up.

5. There needs to be a more elegant way to jump ahead or rewind than having to tap the screen.
